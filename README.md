changed image src from 
// Instead of:

// Use:
<img src={`${import.meta.env.VITE_APP_URL}/images/logo/logo-dark.svg`} />

# Moving Images to back end server
---
#### Based on the code excerpts, I see you have several image references in components like ResponsiveImage.tsx, ThreeColumnImageGrid.tsx, and AppHeader.tsx. Here's my recommendation:
#### For a production environment, it's better to serve static assets like images through your backend for several reasons:
#### Better asset management and caching
#### Centralized storage
#### Ability to implement CDN easily
#### Better security control

##Here's how to implement this:
### 1. First, create a static assets route in your backend. Update your backend's vercel.json:
```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "public/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/images/(.*)",
      "dest": "/public/images/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "server.js"
    }
  ]
}
```
### 2. Move your images from the frontend to a new structure in your backend:
backend-app/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo-dark.svg
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.svg
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ grid-image/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image-01.png
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image-02.png
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image-03.png
### 3. Create an images configuration file in your frontend:

```
src/config
const API_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? 'https://admin-backend-eta.vercel.app'
  : 'http://localhost:5000';

export const getImageUrl = (path: string): string => {
  return `${API_URL}/images/${path}`;
};
```

### 4. Update your components to use the new image URLs. For example:

src/components/ui/images
ResponsiveImage.tsx - Create New in FE App
```
###
```

```
 src/layout/AppHeader.tsx
 import { getImageUrl } from '../config/images.config';

// In your component:
<Link to="/" className="lg:hidden">
  <img
    className="dark:hidden"
    src={getImageUrl('logo/logo.svg')}
    alt="Logo"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src={getImageUrl('logo/logo-dark.svg')}
    alt="Logo"
  />
</Link>
```

## For development environment, add a static file serving middleware to your backend Express app:

```
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the public directory
app.use('/images', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/images')));
```

### 5. Update your environment variables:
```
### VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
### VITE_ASSETS_URL=http://localhost:5000
### VITE_API_URL=https://admin-backend-eta.vercel.app/api
### VITE_ASSETS_URL=https://admin-backend-eta.vercel.app
```

## This setup will:
### Serve images through your backend in both development and production
### Keep your image assets centralized
### Make it easier to implement CDN or other optimizations later
### Maintain consistent URLs across environments
### Allow for better caching and asset management

## Remember to:
### Update all image references in your components
### Test the image loading in both development and production environments
### Consider implementing image optimization middleware in your backend
### Set up proper caching headers for static assets
